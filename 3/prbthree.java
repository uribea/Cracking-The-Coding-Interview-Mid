/*I: Re-state the problem with your own words
  make method to check that all chars in char array are unique
D: Define your goals; state the format of your solution
  i want to check char by char to ensure all chars are unique
E, A: Use Dukeâ€™s 7 steps and include a description on how you broke the problem into sub-problems.
  
  Step 1: Work some small instances by hand
    AA = flase
    ABC = true
    ABCA = false
  Step 2: Write down what you did
    if a character matches a previous character then the answer is false
  Step 3: Find Patterns
    if var seen twice return false
  Step 4: Check by hand
    AtBtCtAf = f
    AtAf = f
    AtBtCt = t
  Step 5: Translate to Code
