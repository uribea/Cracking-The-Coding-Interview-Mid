/*I: Re-state the problem with your own words
	replace all spaces with %20
D: Define your goals; state the format of your solution
	replace spaces with %20 keep word order
E, A: Use Dukeâ€™s 7 steps and include a description on how you broke the problem into sub-problems.
  
	Step 1: Work some small instances by hand
		"ret fort" = "ret%20fort"
		"poet weak" = "poet%20weak"
	Step 2: Write down what you did
		replace spaces with a %20
	Step 3: Find Patterns
		" " = "%20"
	Step 4: Check by hand
		"ret fort poor"
		"ret" + "%20" + "fort" + "%20" + "poor"
	Step 5: Translate to Code

L: Reflect on the whole problem-solving process you went though, and state what you learned 
	realized that strings can be split, if we append a %20 after each word addition then we should solve for almost all conversions
