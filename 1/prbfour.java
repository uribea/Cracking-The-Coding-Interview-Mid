/*I: Re-state the problem with your own words
	check if String can be palindrome
D: Define your goals; state the format of your solution
	what are the rules of a palindrome, write formula for it, check if permutations means a boolean check method
E, A: Use Dukeâ€™s 7 steps and include a description on how you broke the problem into sub-problems.
	
  Step 1: Work some small instances by hand
    "tact cao" = true
	"dog food lid" = false
	"plow lwp" = true
  Step 2: Write down what you did
    must have even number of any type of characters and no more than one of any odd numbered count of characters, not counting spaces
  Step 3: Find Patterns
    return false if more than one character is found an odd number of times
  Step 4: Check by hand
    "tact cao" = t = 2
				 a = 2
				 c = 2 
				 o = 1
  Step 5: Translate to Code
