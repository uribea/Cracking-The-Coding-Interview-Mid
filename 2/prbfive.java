/*I: Re-state the problem with your own words
	add numbers retrieved from linked list with first number seen of each list being the smallest
D: Define your goals; state the format of your solution
  we can add node data to a string with string s = data+s and then parse the string to an int
E, A: Use Dukeâ€™s 7 steps and include a description on how you broke the problem into sub-problems.
  
  Step 1: Work some small instances by hand
    5->7->8 + 9->4->3 = 1224
  Step 2: Write down what you did
    put the numbers with largest first and do normal integer addition
  Step 3: Find Patterns
    we add new numbers to string but since normal integer has revere order of given data we add to the front of the string
  Step 4: Check by hand
     5->7->8 + 9->4->3
	 s = ""
	 s2 = ""
	 s = 5 
	 s = 75
	 s = 875
	 s2 = 9
	 s2 = 49
	 s2 = 349
	 int i = 875
	 int i2 = 349
	 return (i+i2) = 1224
  Step 5: Translate to Code

  Step 7: Debug Failed Test Cases

L: Reflect on the whole problem-solving process you went though, and state what you learned 
	 there are ways to do this with only linked lists, its not hard to treat a linked list like a string especially considering how easy it is to add either to the front or back of either, this method is not good for memory and is likely one of the slowest solutions to this problem.
